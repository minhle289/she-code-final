<h1>Stories from Patients of Breast Cancer</h1>
<h3>Please read below stories from previous patients of breast cancer!</h3>
<div class="boxed">
    <h2>Story 1: JNG | Age: 45</h2>
    <p class="indented">
        The radiologist came out after my routine mammogram and said that there was an area that he thought
    needed to get biopsied. I was in complete shock that I could possibly have breast cancer. I convinced myself
    that the biopsy would be negative. However, to my amazement, the biopsy was positive and it showed that I did have
    breast cancer. I was sure that it would be very very early and very small and therefore plan to do a lumpectomy
    followed by radiation. Once again I was surprised. It turned out that the margins from the piece that was removed
    were positive and more extensive surgery was required. I scheduled a bilateral mastectomy. I was so frightened.
    I had so many questions.I cried every night in the shower. But I was fortunate my PET scan was negative -
    indicating that there was no spread outside of the breast. Although the recovery from surgery itself was
    painful, it was not long before I was back at work and in my usual state of health. I went back to running and
    exercising regularly and I no longer cried! In fact I felt very happy and very fortunate!! I have to say that
    the experience taught me a lot, allowed me to meet people that I might not have met, gave me perspective, and I can
    honestly say that I am truly grateful that I did the surgery and I am a happy person!! I have spoken to many
    people before there surgery and I would be happy to help anyone else going through the same procedure.
    I wish all of you health and happiness.

<h2>Story 2: MN | Age: 46</h2>
<p class="indented">
    I was 46 years old when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I ended up having to do a bilateral mastectomy but I
    can honestly say it was one of the best things I ever did!! My kids were 10, 13 and 14 years old. I think one of
    the hardest parts in the beginning was not knowing what the future would bring and deciding whether or not I was
    going to talk to my kids about what was happening. At first I decided that way I would not tell them because I
    didn’t want to upset them, worry them. However one of my friends texted me well intentioned thoughts saying:
    “we’re going to get through this together we’re all working with you!!” For some reason my daughter read the text
    looked at me and said “oh my God you have breast cancer!” I really didn’t know how to respond because yes I did
    have breast cancer but no I wasn’t ready to discuss this with her or my younger children. I knew I had to be
    honest. I felt like honesty was so important in my family. And I expected my children to be honest with me.
    So I did tell her but, yes, I also said that we were going to do surgery and everything was going to be OK!!
    I think that once the information was out and in the family it was actually a relief for me and my husband.
    We did tell each child separately and they were so incredibly supportive. I was incredibly positive, optimistic,
    but did share the fact that I had to have surgery. I was fortunate to have a great support system and I know from
    them now that they were happy they were able to help in any way they could. Getting me a cup I couldn’t reach from
    a high cupboard, carrying a plate to the table, going downstairs to get the mail we’re all very appreciated
    helpful tasks that made a difference. I could really feel the love. As a family we walked in Breast Cancer Walk
    and raised money for breast cancer research. This was a way that we could give back and give to others who are
    having similar experiences. Today I feel so happy that I am in a place with such an amazing close family.

<h2>Story 3: CH | Age: 50</h2>
<p class="indented">
    I went to see my doctor for a routine check up. During the check up she told me that she felt a small lump in my
    left breast. She called one of her radiology colleagues to see if she would do a mammogram the same day. I think
    the fact that she wanted me to do the mammogram immediately was the most frightening aspect. I left her office and
    went immediately to the radiologist who did a mammogram, an ultrasound and then a biopsy. My doctor and the
    radiologist spoke and then I talk to my Doctor Who was incredibly supportive and comforting and let me know that
    she was going to help me work through whatever findings we had. I can’t remember if my results came back the next
    day or two days later but when my doctor called me to tell me that there was an early breast cancer we had a plan
    in place. I met with a breast cancer surgeon and proceeded with a lumpectomy followed by radiation. After my
    oncology type results came back I met with two different oncologists because my results were in a gray zone.
    It wasn’t clear whether or not chemotherapy would add a lot to my treatment. There was some evidence that having
    chemotherapy might decrease my chances of having a recurrence. My suggestion here when you are given a choice and
    doctors are not sure of which you should do is just speak to your doctor. I had many conversations with all four
    of my new doctors my gynecologist my internist my oncologist and my radiologist. I feel like together we made the
    best decision for me. I ended up doing the chemotherapy and although it was a challenging part of my life it’s now
    behind me and I’m happy that I did it. I know it’s not right for everyone. I’ve certainly gotten a lot more
    exposure to the medical community and I really appreciate the care that my doctors have given me! I think the
    thing that got me through the most was knowing that I had people that I could call at anytime who had gone through
    what I was. I could reach out to my breast cancer support network, my doctors and my friends.
